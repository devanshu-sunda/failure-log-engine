# Failure Log Engine

## Overview

A Python-based failure-first logging system that records and analyzes system failures to identify recurring issues and patterns.

## Why This Project

Most beginner projects focus on successful outcomes. This project intentionally focuses on failures, because real-world systems improve by studying breakdowns rather than successes.

## Features

* Records failures with timestamps and categories
* Persists failure logs across sessions
* Provides basic failure analysis and summaries

## Tech Stack

* Python
* File-based persistence (JSON/CSV)

## Key Learnings

* Designing failure-first systems
* Log structuring and categorization
* Analyzing system weaknesses through data
